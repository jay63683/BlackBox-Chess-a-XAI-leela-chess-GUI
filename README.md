(this is an ongoing project the features described below are the only ones avaliable as of now, I will be adding more in depth XAI features other than the heatmap using ONNX tools in the future)

‚ôö BlackBoxChess: Neural Network Chess Visualization

üí° Overview
BlackBoxChess is an interactive chess visualization platform built in Processing that provides unique insights into chess engine decision-making processes. The project combines classical chess gameplay with neural network analysis visualization, allowing players to understand and explore how chess engines evaluate positions and select moves.

üéØ Core Features
leela chess engine Integration
Full UCI (Universal Chess Interface) protocol support
Real-time engine analysis and move calculation
showcasing of NNs processes and move evaluation.


üé® Visualization System

Neural Network Analysis Heatmap

Color-coded move evaluation visualization (red: high visits( high NN value), blue: low visits(low NN value))
30% transparency overlay for piece visibility
Toggle with 'h' key


Real-time Engine Analysis Display

Win/loss probability
Node exploration count
Dynamic typing animation in the analysis panel



‚öôÔ∏è Engine Control Panel

Temperature Control: Adjusts move selection randomness
Move Time Configuration: Set analysis duration (milliseconds)
moveTime Settings: Configure how much time engine takes to think
Accessible via "settings" tab

üéÆ Gameplay Modes

Human vs Engine

Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
Real-time position evaluation
Dynamic move validation


Engine vs Engine

(may have some issues with)

Auto-play functionality
Real-time analysis visualization
Configurable engine parameters



üéπ Control Reference
